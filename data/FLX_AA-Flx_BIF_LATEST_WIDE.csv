Rowe (1972) places the site in the Missinaibi-Cabonga Section of the Boreal Forest Region. In terms of ecoregion and ecozone, the site is in the Lake Timiskaming Lowlands of the Boreal Shield. The forest developed after high-grade logging in the 1930's. The average age in 2013 is estimated at beteen 75  and 80 years. The forest is dominated by five species characteristic of Ontario boreal mixedwoods: trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). The surficial geology is a lacustrine deposit of varved or massive clays, silts and silty sands. The soil is an orthic gleysol with a soil moisture regime classified as fresh to very fresh.

In the periods between harvests and sowings of the subsequent crop the cropland site mainly represents fallow land (volunteer seedlings or weed species are present only).

This forest has a long history of forestry documentation as well as meteorological and hydrological measurements: (i) climate data since the 1950ies, (ii) hydrological data of the Wernersbach catchment (4.6 km_) since 1968, and (iii) continuous flux measurements by EC technique since 1996. The site is located in the suboceanic/subcontinental climate. According to the long-term records of the adjacent weather station (1959 <d0> 2012) the mean annual air temperature is 7.9 <a1>C (maximum and minimum annual means are 9.5 <a1>C, 2007 and 6.0 <a1>C, 1996, respectively), the mean annual precipitation is 834 mm (maximum and minimum yearly sums are 1287 mm, 1981 and 501 mm, 1982/2003, respectively). The annual course of precipitation has a convective summer maximum and a weaker frontal maximum in winter. Generally, the area is subject to episodic summer droughts with a re-occurrence of about 10 years (see e.g., model results of Churkina et al., 2003); during the investigated period an extremely dry summer occurred in 2003. The main wind direction is SW. The spruce stand at the Anchor Station Tharandt was established by seeding in 1887. Besides the dominating spruce trees some additional trees species are present: in the vicinity of the measurement tower the species of the main canopy are composed of 87 % coniferous evergreen (72 % Picea abies, 15 % Pinus sylvestris) and 13 % deciduous (10 % Larix decidua, 1 % Betula spec., 2 % others). The tree density is 477 trees ha-1, the above ground biomass 213 t ha-1, the leaf area index is 7.6 and the mean canopy height is 26.5 m. The mean breast height diameter is 33 cm. The ground is mainly covered by young Fagus sylvatica (20 %) and Deschampsia flexuosa (50 %). All values are taken from a special inventory of 1999 within a radius of 500 m around the tower. In the vicinity of the tower there are two small not forested areas. In western direction there is an opening of about 1 ha covered mainly with grass (location of the climate station), to the North there are some laboratories of the forestry department (covering about 0.5 ha). A small strip of young 24 years old trees (3.5 ha) composed of spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula spec.) is located in eastern direction. Besides these inhomogeneities there are no fetch restrictions by stand inhomogeneity; topography is limiting the fetch to about 500 m in two small sectors only (Northeast, Southeast). From footprint investigations the site is considered to represent the specified target land cover type very well (G<9a>ckede et al., 2007). In April 2002 and Feb/Mar 2011 there were  thinnings at the site (estimated biomass export of 60m_/ha and 53m_/ha, resp.). The soil is characterised by a loamy skeleton podsol-brown earth which is typical for the lower parts of the eastern Ore Mountains (Nebe and Wenk, 1997). The soil depth is around 1 m, the depth of the main rooting zone is 35 cm. The soil water field capacity and the wilting point were estimated to 16 Vol-% and 7 Vol-%, respectively.

The Mediterranean-type climate of California is characterized by a protracted summer drought, with precipitation occurring mainly from October through May. The infrastructure for the ecosystem scale flux measurements includes a walkup measurement tower, two temperature controlled instrument buildings, and an electrical generation system powered by a diesel generator. Typical wind patterns at the site include upslope flow during the day (from the west) and downslope flow at night (from the east). The plantation is relatively flat, and contains a homogenous mixture of evenly aged ponderosa pine with other trees and shrubs scattered throughout the ecosystem making up less than 30% of the biomass. The daytime fetch for the tower measurements extends approximately 200 m to the southwest of the tower (this region contributes ~90% of the daytime flux), thus remote sensing images to be used for modeling should probably be centered approximately 100 m from the tower at an angle of 225 deg.","DOE/NIGEC, EPA, University of California",NA,NA,NA,NA,http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/~ahg/tgbl/group.html,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,CA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Since 2001, the marsh has been managed to maintain year-round inundation with the lowest water levels in September. Within the 0<d0>250_m fetch of the tower, the marsh comprises 42.9% of floating-leaved vegetation, 52.7% of emergent vegetation, and 4.4% of dike and upland during the growing season. Dominant emergent plants include narrow-leaved cattail (Typha angustifolia), rose mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos), and bur reed (Sparganium americanum).
